Project kick-off session, where you should get clear of what and why this project is and all other questions you have with regards to the project

### Questions to ask before starting with the dashboard

- What is the objective of building this PowerBi dashboard?
- In what terms the success of this project will be measured?
- What will be the time deadline for the project?
- do the stakeholders expect a preview before the actual release?
- What are all the hopes stakeholders have out of this project?
- what are all the fears the stakeholders have in terms of building this dashboard?
- Who will be using this dashboard and for what purpose?
- what are all expectations the stakeholders have, by the completion of this project?
- What can go wrong while building this project?
- what are all the resources/ data needed to build this dashboard?
- is there any input from stakeholders in terms of design and views of the dashboard?

After the project kick-off meetings, the data engineering team has given the data as per the request of the data analytics team, letâ€™s explore them.

### Dataset **Understanding.**

Understanding what data is available will be more helpful while doing analysis. before jumping on to the analysis get a good understanding of what are data available.

Dimension table: It will have static data like details of customers and products

Fact table: It will have the data about the transactions

            - Higher customer satisfaction
            - Reduced cost in warehouses for storage purposes
        - The table is denormalized by the data engineering team, as it is a data warehouse that is aimed to be used for analytical work.
        - All the dates of the month will be replaced by the start date of the month
        - It will have all the column names and in the end it will have the forecast quantity needed of the customer

## Importing data into PowerBi

- As the database is MySQL in this project, we need to import the datasets from Mysql database to PowerBi by providing the Database access credential

## Data Model

- Data modeling plays a vital role and is considered as the basement of the report. All the visuals will be built upon the data model.
- Poor data modeling affects the overall performance of the report.
- Following Good practices of data modeling is a must. Refer to this page to get to know the good practices [Blog](https://addendanalytics.com/blog/data-modelling-best-practices/)
- In this project, we have followed the Snowfall data modeling method.
